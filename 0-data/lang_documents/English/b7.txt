Here are some tips on how to ask questions to find out about others in English:

* Start with basic questions. This could include things like their name, age, where they're from, what they do for a living, and their hobbies. These questions are a good way to break the ice and get started.
* Ask open-ended questions. These are questions that require more than a yes or no answer. Instead, they encourage the person to share more about themselves and their experiences. For example, instead of asking "Do you like to travel?", you could ask "What's your favorite place you've ever traveled to?"
* Be specific. The more specific you are with your questions, the more informative the answers will be. For example, instead of asking "What do you like to do for fun?", you could ask "What's your favorite book to read?" or "What's your favorite TV show to watch?"
* Be respectful. When asking questions about someone's personal life, be mindful of their boundaries. Don't ask anything that you wouldn't feel comfortable answering yourself.

Here are some examples of good questions to ask to find out about others in English:

* What are you passionate about?
* What's your dream job?
* What's the best piece of advice you've ever received?
* What's your favorite thing about yourself?
* What's your biggest challenge right now?
* What's your favorite thing to do in your free time?
* What's your favorite place to travel?
* What's your favorite book to read?
* What's your favorite movie to watch?
* What's your favorite TV show to watch?
* What's your favorite food?
* What's your favorite thing to do on a rainy day?

If you're new to the English language, here are some additional tips for asking questions:

* Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they're learning a new language. The important thing is to keep practicing.
* If you don't understand something, ask for clarification. Don't just nod your head and pretend you understand.
* Use simple language. It's better to use simple language that you're comfortable with than to use complex language that you might not understand or pronounce correctly.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're struggling to ask a question, ask someone to help you.

Remember, the most important thing is to be genuine and interested in learning more about the person you're talking to. If you're sincere, people will be more likely to open up to you and share their stories.
