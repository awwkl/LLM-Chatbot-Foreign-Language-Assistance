Here are some ways to ask for help with understanding what something means in English:

* Start by saying "Sorry, I don't understand." This is a polite way to let the other person know that you need their help.
* Be more specific about what you don't understand. For example, you could say "I don't understand this word" or "I don't understand the instructions on this sign."
* Ask for clarification. You could say "Could you please explain what this means?" or "Could you please rephrase that?"
* Ask for an example. This can be helpful if you're having trouble understanding a concept. You could say "Could you please give me an example of what you mean?" or "Could you please show me how to do that?"

Here are some examples of how to ask for help in specific situations:

* If you don't understand an announcement:
    * "Sorry, I don't understand. Could you please repeat that?"
    * "Excuse me, I'm not sure what that means. Could you please explain it to me?"

* If you don't understand someone's instructions:
    * "Sorry, I don't understand. Could you please rephrase that?"

Here are some tips for asking for help in English:

* Be polite. Remember that the person you're asking for help from is giving you their time and attention.
