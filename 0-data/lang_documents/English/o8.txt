Here are some tips on how to negotiate or haggle the price in English:

* Do your research. Before you start negotiating, it's important to know the fair market value of the item you're interested in. You can do this by comparing prices online or in other stores. This will give you a good starting point for your negotiation.
* Be polite but assertive. When you're negotiating, it's important to be polite but assertive. You want to make sure that the other person knows that you're serious about getting a good deal, but you don't want to be rude or aggressive.
* Be prepared to walk away. If you're not happy with the price that the other person is offering, be prepared to walk away. This shows them that you're not afraid to take your business elsewhere.

Here are some examples of phrases you can use when negotiating price in English:

* "I'm interested in buying this, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Can you work with me on this?"
* "I'm on a budget, but I really like this item. Is there anything you can do on the price?"
* "I'm willing to buy this today if you can give me a discount."
* "I've seen this item for cheaper somewhere else. Are you willing to match that price?"
* "I'm willing to buy multiple items if you can give me a bulk discount."

Here are some additional tips for negotiating price in English, especially for someone new to the language:

* Speak slowly and clearly. Make sure that the other person understands what you're saying.
* Use simple language. Avoid using complex phrases or jargon.
* Be direct. Get to the point quickly and don't beat around the bush.
* Be patient. Negotiating can take time, so be prepared to be patient and persistent.

If you're not sure how to say something in English, you can always ask the other person for help. They will be happy to assist you, especially if you are polite and respectful.

Finally, remember that negotiating is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. Don't be discouraged if you don't get the best deal right away. Just keep practicing and you'll eventually become a pro at negotiating price in English.
