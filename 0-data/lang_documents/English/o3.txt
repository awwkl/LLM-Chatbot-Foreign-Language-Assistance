Here are some tips on how to ask for recommendations for food in a restaurant or what to buy in a shop in English:

Tips:

* Be polite and friendly.
* Be specific about what you are looking for. For example, instead of saying "What do you recommend?", you could say "Do you have any recommendations for vegetarian dishes?" or "What is your favorite thing to buy here?"
* If you have any dietary restrictions or allergies, be sure to mention them.
* If you are unsure of what something is, ask. The staff will be happy to help you.

Examples:

* Food:
    * "Do you have any recommendations for vegetarian dishes?"
    * "What is your favorite thing to order here?"
    * "What is your most popular dish?"
    * "What is the house specialty?"
    * "Can you recommend a good wine to go with this dish?"
* Shopping:
    * "Do you have any recommendations for what to buy here?"
    * "What is your best-selling product?"
    * "What is your most popular item?"
    * "Can you recommend something for a gift?"
    * "Can you help me find something for [specific purpose]?"

Other advice for someone new to the English language:

* Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language.
* If you don't understand something, ask for clarification.
* Be patient with yourself. It takes time to learn a new language.

Here are some additional tips for asking for recommendations in a restaurant or shop:

* If you are unsure of how to pronounce something, you can ask the staff to help you.
* If you are shy about speaking English, you can write down your question on a piece of paper and show it to the staff.
* If you are unsure of what to say, you can try using a phrasebook or translation app.

Remember, the most important thing is to be polite and friendly. The staff will be happy to help you choose the best food or products for your needs.
