Here are some tips on how to convey your dietary restrictions in English:

* Be specific. Don't just say that you have a food allergy or intolerance; say which food(s) you can't eat. For example, instead of saying "I have a food allergy," say "I have a severe allergy to peanuts."
* Use clear and simple language. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that the other person may not understand. For example, instead of saying "I have celiac disease," say "I can't eat gluten."
* Be prepared to answer questions. The other person may ask you about your dietary restrictions, so be ready to explain them in more detail. For example, if you have a food allergy, you may be asked about the severity of your allergy and whether or not you need to avoid cross-contamination.

Here are some examples of how to convey your dietary restrictions in English:

* I'm allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish.
* I'm lactose intolerant, so I can't eat dairy products.
* I'm a vegetarian, so I don't eat meat or fish.
* I'm a vegan, so I don't eat any animal products, including meat, fish, eggs, and dairy.
* I have celiac disease, so I can't eat gluten.

If you are new to the English language, here are some additional tips:

* Practice saying your dietary restrictions in English. This will help you to feel more confident when communicating with others.
* Use a translation app or dictionary to help you translate your dietary restrictions into English.
* Ask a friend or family member who speaks English to help you communicate your dietary restrictions to others.

It is also important to be assertive and to advocate for yourself. If you are ordering food at a restaurant, don't be afraid to ask about the ingredients in the dishes or to request modifications. If you are attending a social event, let the host or hostess know about your dietary restrictions in advance.

Here are some additional tips for communicating your dietary restrictions in English:

* Be polite and respectful. Even if you are frustrated, it is important to be polite and respectful to the other person.
* Be patient. It may take some time to explain your dietary restrictions to someone who is new to them.
* Be understanding. The other person may not always be able to accommodate your dietary restrictions, but they should be willing to try.

If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask.
