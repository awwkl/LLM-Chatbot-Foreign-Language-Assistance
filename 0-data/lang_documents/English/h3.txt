Here is how to provide your address in an emergency situation in English:

1. Speak clearly and slowly.
2. State your address in a complete and concise manner.
3. If you are unsure of your exact address, try to provide as much detail as possible about your location, such as the name of the building or intersection you are near.

Here are some examples:

* 911 operator: What is your address?
* Caller: My address is 123 Main Street, Anytown, CA 91234.
* 911 operator: Okay, and what kind of emergency is this?
* Caller: There is a fire in my building.

* 911 operator: What is your address?
* Caller: I'm not sure of my exact address, but I'm at the corner of Elm Street and Maple Street in downtown Anytown.
* 911 operator: Okay, and what kind of emergency is this?
* Caller: I'm having a heart attack.

Here are some tips and advice for someone new to the English language:

* If you are not sure how to pronounce a word, ask the 911 operator to help you.
* If you have a strong accent, the 911 operator may have difficulty understanding you. Speak slowly and clearly, and repeat yourself if necessary.
* If you are unable to speak English, try to find someone who can translate for you.

If you are in an emergency situation and do not have access to a phone, you can try to get the attention of someone who can help you. Shout for help or wave your arms. If you are in a public place, you can also try to find a security guard or police officer.

It is important to know your address in English, even if you are not fluent in the language. This information is vital for emergency services to be able to locate you and provide assistance.
