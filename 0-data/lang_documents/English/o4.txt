Here are some examples of how to ask if a shop sells a certain item, and where it is, in English:

* Excuse me, do you sell [item name]?
* Can you tell me if you have [item name] in stock?
* I'm looking for [item name]. Do you have it here?
* Where can I find [item name] in this store?
* Is there a [department name] where I can find [item name]?

If you are not sure of the name of the item in English, you can try to describe it to the shopkeeper. For example, you could say:

* I'm looking for a small, black bag with a strap.
* I'm looking for a book with a blue cover and a picture of a cat on it.
* I'm looking for a pair of shoes that are size 10 and black in color.

If you are new to the English language, here are a few tips:

* Be polite and respectful when asking your question.
* Speak slowly and clearly.
* Don't be afraid to repeat yourself if the shopkeeper does not understand you.
* If you are still having trouble, try to find someone who can help you translate.

Here are some other things to keep in mind:

* Some shops may not have the item you are looking for in stock. If this is the case, the shopkeeper may be able to tell you when they will have it back in stock, or they may be able to recommend another shop where you can find it.
* Some shops may have a different name for the item you are looking for. For example, a "jumper" in the UK is called a "sweater" in the US.
* Some shops may have the item you are looking for in a different location than where you are standing. For example, the grocery store may have the bread in the baking aisle, while the milk is in the dairy aisle.

If you are still having trouble finding the item you are looking for, you can always try asking a friend or family member for help.
