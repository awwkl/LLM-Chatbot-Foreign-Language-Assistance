The most common way to ask if you can pay in cash or card in English is:

> Do you accept cash or card?

You can also say:

> Can I pay by cash or card?
>
> How would you like me to pay?
>
> What forms of payment do you accept?

If you are unsure whether a business accepts cash or card, it is always best to ask. This is especially true in smaller businesses or in countries where cash is more common.

Here are some examples of how to ask if you can pay in cash or card in different situations:

* At a restaurant: "Do you accept cash or card?"
* At a store: "Can I pay by cash or card?"
* At a taxi: "How would you like me to pay?"
* At a hotel: "What forms of payment do you accept?"

Tips for someone new to the English language:

* Be aware that some businesses may have a minimum purchase amount for card payments.
* If you are paying in cash, make sure to have the exact amount, if possible.
* If you are paying by card, be prepared to sign your receipt and provide your PIN number.
* If you are unsure of anything, don't be afraid to ask for help.

Here is some additional advice for someone new to the English language:

* When you are speaking English, try to speak slowly and clearly.
* If you don't understand something, ask the person to repeat it.
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language.

Learning a new language can be challenging, but it is also very rewarding. With practice, you will be able to communicate effectively in English and feel more confident in your new language skills.
