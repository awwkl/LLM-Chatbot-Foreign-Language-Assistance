* Be polite. When asking for help in Italian, it is always polite to start with the word "scusi" (excuse me). You can also say "per favore" (please) at the end of your request.
* Be specific. If you need help with a specific task, be sure to explain it to the person you are asking for help. For example, if you need help finding your way to a train station, you could say "Scusi, mi può aiutare a trovare la stazione dei treni?" (Excuse me, can you help me find the train station?)
