Italian goodbyes for beginners:

* Arrivederci: (Goodbye, Arrivederchi)
* Ciao: (Bye, Ciao)
* A presto: (See you soon, Ah presto)
* A domani: (See you tomorrow, Ah doh-mah-nee)
* A dopo: (Later, Ah doh-poh)
* Ci vediamo: (We'll see each other, Chee veh-dee-ah-moh)
* Alla prossima: (Until next time, Ah-lah pross-see-mah)

Tips for saying goodbye in Italian:

* Choose the right goodbye for the situation. Arrivederci is a formal goodbye that can be used in any situation, while ciao is a more informal goodbye that is best used with friends and family. A presto, a domani, and a dopo are all informal goodbyes that can be used when you plan on seeing the person again soon. Ci vediamo is a more general goodbye that can be used in a variety of situations. Alla prossima is a more formal goodbye that is often used in business settings.
* Use the correct pronunciation. Italian pronunciation can be tricky, so it is important to practice saying goodbye correctly. The pronunciation guide above should help, but you can also listen to native Italian speakers saying goodbye online or in Italian movies and TV shows.
* Don't forget the body language. Italians often use gestures when they say goodbye. A common gesture is to wave goodbye with the hand that is closest to the person you are saying goodbye to. You can also give the person a hug or a kiss on the cheek, depending on your relationship with them.

Additional tip:

If you are unsure of which goodbye to use, it is always better to err on the side of caution and use a more formal goodbye. You can always explain to the person that you are still learning Italian and that you are not sure which goodbye is appropriate.
