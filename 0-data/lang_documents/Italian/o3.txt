Tips:

* Be polite. When asking for recommendations in Italian, it is always polite to say "per favore" (please) and "grazie" (thank you).
* Be specific. If you have any specific dietary restrictions or preferences, be sure to mention them to the waiter or shopkeeper. This will help them to give you more relevant recommendations.
* Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you are unsure about something, don't be afraid to ask the waiter or shopkeeper for more information. They are happy to help you.
