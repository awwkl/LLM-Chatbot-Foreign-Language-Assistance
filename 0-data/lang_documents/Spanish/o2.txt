Here are some ways to convey your dietary restrictions in Spanish, for someone new to the Spanish language:

Spanish words: (English translation, English pronunciation)

* Tengo alergia a...: I am allergic to... (TEN-goh ah-LEHR-gee-ah ah...)
* Soy intolerante a...: I am intolerant to... (SOY in-toh-leh-RAHN-tay ah...)
* No puedo comer...: I cannot eat... (noh PWEH-doh koh-MEHR...)
* ¿Este plato tiene...?: Does this dish have...? (¿EH-steh PLAH-toh TEE-eh-neh...?)
* ¿Me podría preparar un plato sin...?: Could you make me a dish without...? (¿Meh po-DREE-ah preh-pah-RAHR oon PLAH-toh seen...?)
* ¿Hay alguna opción vegetariana/vegana?: Are there any vegetarian/vegan options? (¿Ay ahl-GOO-nah ohp-see-OHN veh-heh-tah-REE-ah/veh-GAH-nah?)

Here are some examples of how to use these phrases:

* Tengo alergia a los mariscos. (I am allergic to shellfish.)
* Soy intolerante a la lactosa. (I am lactose intolerant.)
* No puedo comer gluten. (I cannot eat gluten.)
* ¿Este plato tiene nueces?: (Does this dish have nuts?)
* ¿Me podría preparar un plato sin ajo?: (Could you make me a dish without garlic?)
* ¿Hay alguna opción vegetariana?: (Are there any vegetarian options?)

Tips for conveying your dietary restrictions in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be specific about your dietary restrictions. For example, instead of saying "Tengo alergia a la comida", say "Tengo alergia a los mariscos, los frutos secos y el gluten" (I am allergic to shellfish, nuts, and gluten).
* If you are not sure how to say something in Spanish, don't be afraid to ask for help. Most waiters and waitresses are happy to help tourists.

Here are some additional tips:

* If you have a dietary restriction card in English, you can show it to the waiter or waitress. They may be able to translate it or understand it.
* If you are unsure of whether or not a dish is safe for you to eat, it is always better to err on the side of caution and ask the waiter or waitress.
* Be prepared to explain your dietary restrictions in more detail, if necessary. For example, if you are allergic to peanuts, you may need to explain that you cannot eat any foods that contain peanuts or peanut oil.

I hope this helps!
