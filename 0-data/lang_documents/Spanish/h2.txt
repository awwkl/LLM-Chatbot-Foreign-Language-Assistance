Here are some ways to ask for help with understanding something in Spanish, for someone new to the Spanish language:

Spanish words: (English translation, English pronunciation)

* No entiendo esto, ¿me podrías ayudar a entenderlo?: I don't understand this, can you help me understand it? (Noh en-TYEN-doh es-toh, ¿meh poh-DREE-ahs ah-yoo-DAH ah en-ten-der-loh?)
* ¿Podrías repetirlo, por favor?: Could you repeat that, please? (¿Poh-DREE-ahs reh-peh-TEER-loh, por fah-BOHR?)

Tips for asking for help with understanding something in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be specific about what you don't understand. For example, instead of saying "No entiendo esto", say "No entiendo el significado de esta palabra" (I don't understand the meaning of this word) or "No entiendo esta frase" (I don't understand this sentence).
* Don't be afraid to ask for clarification. It's better to ask than to sit there confused.

Here are some additional tips for asking for help with understanding something:

* Try to explain what you already know about the topic. This will help the person you are speaking to to understand what you are struggling with.
* Use gestures and facial expressions to help you communicate.
* Be patient and understanding. It may take the person a moment to understand what you need.
* Say "gracias" (thank you) when the person has helped you to understand.

I hope this helps!
