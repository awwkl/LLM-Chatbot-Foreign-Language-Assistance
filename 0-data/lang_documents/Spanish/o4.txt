Here are some ways to ask if a shop sells a certain item and where it is in Spanish, for someone new to the Spanish language:

Spanish words: (English translation, English pronunciation)

* ¿Venden...?: Do you sell...? (¿VEN-den...?)
* ¿Tienen...?: Do you have...? (¿TEE-eh-nen...?)
* ¿Dónde está el/la...?: Where is the...? (¿DÓN-deh es-TAH el/la...?)
* ¿Me podría llevar al/la...?: Could you take me to the...? (¿Meh po-DREE-ah yeh-VAR al/la...?)

Examples:

* ¿Venden libros en español? (Do you sell books in Spanish?)
* ¿Tienen sombreros de sol? (Do you have sun hats?)
* ¿Dónde está la sección de ropa de mujer? (Where is the women's clothing section?)
* ¿Me podría llevar a la sección de electrónica? (Could you take me to the electronics section?)

Tips for asking if a shop sells a certain item and where it is in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be specific about what you are looking for. For example, instead of saying "Busco algo para regalar", say "Busco un regalo para mi madre" (I'm looking for a gift for my mother).
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are not sure what to say or where to find what you are looking for, ask a salesperson for help.

Here are some additional tips:

* If you are looking for a specific brand or type of item, be sure to specify that.
* If you are not sure how to say something in Spanish, don't be afraid to ask for help. Most salespeople are happy to help tourists.
* Be patient and understanding. It may take the salesperson a few minutes to find what you are looking for.

I hope this helps!
