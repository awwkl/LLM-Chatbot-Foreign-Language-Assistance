Here are some ways to greet people at different times of day in Spanish, for someone new to the Spanish language:

Spanish words: (English translation, English pronunciation)

* Buenos días: Good morning (boo-EHNOS dee-AHSS)
* Buenas tardes: Good afternoon (boo-EHNOS TAR-dess)
* Buenas noches: Good evening/night (boo-EHNOS NOH-chess)

Tips for greeting people at different times of day in Spanish:

* Use "buenos días" in the morning, "buenas tardes" in the afternoon, and "buenas noches" in the evening/night.
* If you are greeting someone for the first time, you can say "buenos días, buenas tardes, or buenas noches" followed by their name. For example: "Buenos días, Juan."
* If you are greeting a group of people, you can say "buenos días, buenas tardes, or buenas noches a todos." (Good morning/afternoon/evening/night, everyone.)
* If you are unsure of what time of day it is, you can always say "hola" (hello), which is a general greeting that can be used at any time of day.

Here are some additional tips for greeting people in Spanish:

* Be sure to make eye contact and smile.
* If you are greeting someone you don't know very well, shake their hand.
* If you are greeting someone you know well, you may hug or kiss them on the cheek (depending on your culture and relationship with the person).

I hope this helps!
