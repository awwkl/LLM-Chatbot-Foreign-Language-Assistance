* Be prepared to walk away if you don't get the price you want.
* Be patient and persistent. It may take some time to get the best price.
* Don't be afraid to smile and use humor.
* Be willing to compromise. You may not get the exact price you want, but you should be able to get a price that you are happy with.

Here are some additional tips:

* Do some research before you go shopping. This will help you to know what a fair price is for the item you are interested in.
* Be willing to pay a bit more if you are really interested in an item. However, don't be afraid to bargain, especially if you are buying multiple items or if you are paying in cash.
* Be aware of the cultural norms in the country you are visiting. In some countries, it is considered rude to bargain, while in others it is expected.
