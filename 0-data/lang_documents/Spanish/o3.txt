Here are some ways to ask for recommendations for food in a restaurant or what to buy in a shop in Spanish, for someone new to the Spanish language:

Spanish words: (English translation, English pronunciation)

* ¿Qué me recomienda?: What do you recommend? (¿keh meh reh-koh-MYEN-dah?)
* ¿Qué plato es el más popular?: What is the most popular dish? (¿keh PLAH-toh es el mas poh-poo-LAHR?)
* ¿Qué plato me recomienda para...?: What dish do you recommend for...? (¿keh PLAH-toh meh reh-koh-MYEN-dah pah-rah...?)
* ¿Qué producto es el más popular?: What is the most popular product? (¿keh proh-DOHK-toh es el mas poh-poo-LAHR?)
* ¿Qué producto me recomienda para...?: What product do you recommend for...? (¿keh proh-DOHK-toh meh reh-koh-MYEN-dah pah-rah...?)

Examples:

* ¿Qué me recomienda para el almuerzo? (What do you recommend for lunch?)
* ¿Qué plato es el más popular en este restaurante? (What is the most popular dish in this restaurant?)
* ¿Qué plato me recomienda para alguien que es vegetariano? (What dish do you recommend for someone who is a vegetarian?)
* ¿Qué producto es el más popular en esta tienda? (What is the most popular product in this shop?)
* ¿Qué producto me recomienda para alguien que tiene la piel sensible? (What product do you recommend for someone who has sensitive skin?)

Tips for asking for recommendations in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be specific about what you are looking for. For example, instead of saying "Quiero un plato de comida", say "Quiero un plato de comida italiana" (I want a plate of Italian food).
* Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you are not sure what to order or buy, ask the waiter, waitress, or shopkeeper for help.

Here are some additional tips:

* If you are asking for a recommendation for food, you can tell the waiter or waitress what your dietary restrictions are, if any. They will be able to recommend dishes that are safe for you to eat.
* If you are asking for a recommendation for a product, you can tell the shopkeeper what your needs are. They will be able to recommend products that are right for you.
* Be open to trying new things. The waiter, waitress, or shopkeeper may recommend something that you have never tried before. Don't be afraid to give it a try!

I hope this helps!
