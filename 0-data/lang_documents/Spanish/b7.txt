Tips for asking questions to find out about others in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be interested in the person's answers. Listen carefully and ask follow-up questions.
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language.

Here are some additional tips for getting to know someone in Spanish:

* Talk about your interests. This is a great way to find common ground with the other person.
* Share stories about yourself. This will help the other person to get to know you better.
* Ask questions about the other person's life. This shows that you are interested in them.
* Be a good listener. Pay attention to what the other person is saying and respond thoughtfully.
* Be respectful of the other person's culture and beliefs.
