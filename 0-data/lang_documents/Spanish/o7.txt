Here are some ways to ask if you can pay in cash or card in Spanish, for someone new to the Spanish language:

Spanish words: (English translation, English pronunciation)

* ¿Se puede pagar con tarjeta?: Can I pay with a card? (¿Seh pwEH-day kohn tah-RHEH-tah?)
* ¿Aceptan tarjetas?: Do you accept cards? (¿Ah-SEH-ptahN tah-RHEH-tahs?)
* ¿Puedo pagar en efectivo?: Can I pay in cash? (¿PWEH-doh pah-GAHR en eh-FEH-ktee-voh?)

Example:

* ¿Se puede pagar con tarjeta?: Can I pay with a card?

Tips for asking if you can pay in cash or card in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be specific about what you are asking about. For example, instead of saying "¿Se puede pagar?", say "¿Se puede pagar con tarjeta?" (Can I pay with a card?)
* Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you are not sure how to say something or if you don't understand the answer, ask for help.

Here are some additional tips:

* If you are unsure of whether or not a business accepts cards, it is always best to ask.
* If you are paying in cash, be sure to have the exact amount, if possible. This will help to avoid any confusion.
* If you are paying with a card, be sure to sign the receipt.

I hope this helps!
