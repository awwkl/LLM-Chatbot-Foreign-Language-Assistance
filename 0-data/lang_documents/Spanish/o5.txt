Tips for asking how much something costs in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be specific about what you are asking about. For example, instead of saying "¿Cuánto cuesta?", say "¿Cuánto cuesta esta camisa?" (How much does this shirt cost?)
* Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you are not sure how to say something or if you don't understand the answer, ask for help.

Here are some additional tips:

* If you are bargaining for a price, you can use the phrase "¿Cuál es el mejor precio?" (What is the best price?)
* If you are unsure of how much something should cost, it is helpful to do some research beforehand. This will help you to avoid getting overcharged.
* Be prepared to pay in cash. Many businesses in Spanish-speaking countries do not accept credit cards.
