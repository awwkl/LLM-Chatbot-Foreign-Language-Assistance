To ask what something is in Spanish, you can use the following phrases:

Spanish words: (English translation, English pronunciation)

* ¿Qué es esto?: What is this? (¿Keh es EH-stoh?)
* ¿Cómo se llama esto?: What is this called? (¿KOH-moh seh YAH-mah EH-stoh?)
* ¿Para qué sirve esto?: What is this used for? (¿PAH-rah keh SIHR-veh EH-stoh?)

Examples:

* ¿Qué es esto?: What is this? (Pointing to an object)
* ¿Cómo se llama esto?: What is this called? (Pointing to a menu item)
* ¿Para qué sirve esto?: What is this used for? (Pointing to a tool)

Tips for asking what something is in Spanish:

* Be polite and respectful.
* Use the appropriate form of address, depending on the person you are speaking to. For example, you would use "usted" (formal you) when speaking to someone older than you or someone you don't know well. You would use "tú" (informal you) when speaking to friends or family.
* Be specific about what you are asking about. For example, instead of saying "¿Qué es?", say "¿Qué es esto?" (What is this?)
* Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you are not sure how to say something or if you don't understand the answer, ask for help.

Here are some additional tips:

* If you are unsure of how to say something in Spanish, you can try to describe it. For example, instead of saying "¿Qué es esto?", you could say "Es una fruta roja y redonda" (It's a red and round fruit).
* You can also use gestures to help you communicate. For example, you could point to what you are asking about or make a gesture that shows how it is used.
* Be patient and understanding. It may take the person you are speaking to a few seconds to understand what you are asking.

I hope this helps!
