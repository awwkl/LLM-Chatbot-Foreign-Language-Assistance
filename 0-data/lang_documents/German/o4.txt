German words:

* Verkaufen Sie [item name]? (Do you sell [item name]?) - Ver-kau-fen Sie [item name]? (Ver-kow-fen zee [item name]?)
* Wo ist der [item name]? (Where is the [item name]?) - Vo ist der [item name]? (Vo ist der [item name]?)

Examples:

* Verkaufen Sie Brot? (Do you sell bread?)
* Wo ist der Käse? (Where is the cheese?)
* Verkaufen Sie Milch? (Do you sell milk?)
* Wo sind die Eier? (Where are the eggs?)
* Verkaufen Sie Obst? (Do you sell fruit?)
* Wo ist das Gemüse? (Where is the vegetable?)

Tips:

* If you don't know the German word for the item you're looking for, you can try pointing at it or describing it.
* Be sure to use the polite form of "you" (Sie) when speaking to someone in German.
* If you're still learning German, don't be afraid to ask for help from a native speaker. They'll usually be happy to help you find what you're looking for.

Specific tips for asking if a shop sells a certain item:

* Be specific about the item you're looking for. If you're just asking for "bread," for example, the shopkeeper might not know what kind of bread you want. Instead, ask for "Vollkornbrot" (whole wheat bread), "Schwarzbrot" (rye bread), or "Roggenbrot" (rye bread).
* If you're looking for a specific brand of an item, be sure to mention that. For example, instead of asking for "water," you could ask for "Volvic" or "Evian" water.
* If you're not sure if a shop sells a certain item, you can always ask. The shopkeeper will be happy to tell you if they have the item in stock or not.
