Here are some examples of how to ask where a place is and how to get there in German, for someone new to the language:

German words: Wo ist der Bahnhof? (Where is the train station?, Wo ist der bahn-hof)
German words: Wo ist die Apotheke? (Where is the pharmacy?, Wo ist dee ah-poh-tay-kuh)
German words: Wo ist das Hotel? (Where is the hotel?, Wo ist das ho-tell)
German words: Wo ist ein Supermarkt? (Where is a supermarket?, Wo ist ein soo-per-markt)
German words: Wie komme ich zum Bahnhof? (How do I get to the train station?, Vee kohm-uh ih tsoom bahn-hof)
German words: Wie komme ich zur Apotheke? (How do I get to the pharmacy?, Vee kohm-uh ih tsoor ah-poh-tay-kuh)
German words: Wie komme ich zum Hotel? (How do I get to the hotel?, Vee kohm-uh ih tsoom ho-tell)
German words: Wie komme ich zu einem Supermarkt? (How do I get to a supermarket?, Vee kohm-uh ih tsoom eem soo-per-markt)

Tips:

* Be sure to use the correct article with the noun you are asking about. German nouns have three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The article depends on the gender of the noun and its case.
* If you are asking for directions to a specific place, use the accusative case. The accusative case is used for direct objects.
* If you are asking for directions to a general type of place, use the dative case. The dative case is used for indirect objects.
* You can also use the phrase "Bitte zeigen Sie mir..." (Please show me...) to ask for directions. For example, you could say "Bitte zeigen Sie mir den Bahnhof." (Please show me the train station.)
* Don't be afraid to speak slowly and clearly. Most German people are happy to help visitors, even if their German is not perfect.

Here are some additional tips specific to your question:

* When asking for directions, it is helpful to know where you are starting from. For example, you could say "Ich bin am Rathaus. Wie komme ich zum Bahnhof?" (I am at the city hall. How do I get to the train station?)
* If you are not sure how to say the name of the place you are asking about, you can describe it. For example, you could say "Ich suche ein Gesch√§ft, wo ich Brot kaufen kann." (I am looking for a store where I can buy bread.)
* Be prepared to give the person you are asking for directions some more information, such as how you are traveling (on foot, by bike, or by public transportation).

I hope this helps!
