Here are some examples of how to ask if you can pay in cash or card in German, formatted like you requested:

German words:

* Kann ich bar oder mit Karte zahlen? (Can I pay in cash or with a card?, Can ih bar odir mit kar-teh zah-len?)
* Möchten Sie bar oder mit Karte bezahlt werden? (Do you want to be paid in cash or by card?, Moech-ten zee bar odir mit kar-teh bah-tsalt wer-den?)
* Akzeptieren Sie Kreditkarten? (Do you accept credit cards?, Ahk-tsep-tee-ren zee kre-dit-kar-ten?)

Tips:

* If you are unsure of which pronoun to use (du or Sie), it is always safe to use the formal pronoun Sie.
* If you are asking about a specific type of card, such as a credit card, you can say "Kreditkarte" or "Kreditkarte accepted?".
* If you are paying for multiple people, you can say "Wir möchten bar oder mit Karte bezahlen" (We would like to pay in cash or by card).

Here are some specific tips for asking if you can pay in cash or card in German:

* Be sure to pronounce the words correctly. German pronunciation can be tricky, so it is helpful to practice saying the phrases out loud before you use them in a real-world situation.
* Be polite and respectful. When asking to pay, it is always a good idea to say "Bitte" (please).
* Be aware that some businesses in Germany may not accept credit cards, especially smaller businesses and restaurants. It is always a good idea to have some cash on hand just in case.

I hope this helps!
