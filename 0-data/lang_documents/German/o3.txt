Here are some examples of how to ask for recommendations for food in a restaurant or what to buy in a shop, in German, for someone new to the German language:

Food:

* German words: (English translation, English pronunciation)
    * Was empfehlen Sie? (What do you recommend?, vas em-pfee-len zee?)
    * Was ist Ihre Spezialität? (What is your specialty?, vas ist ee-reh spe-tzee-a-leet?)
    * Was würden Sie mir empfehlen? (What would you recommend to me?, vas wuer-den zee mir em-pfee-len?)

Example:

> Ich bin neu in dieser Stadt und kenne keine guten Restaurants. Was empfehlen Sie? (I'm new to this city and I don't know any good restaurants. What do you recommend?)

Shop:

    * Was ist Ihr Bestseller? (What is your bestseller?, vas ist eer best-sell-air?)
    * Was können Sie mir empfehlen? (What can you recommend to me?, vas ken-nen zee mir em-pfee-len?)
    * Was ist hier besonders beliebt? (What is particularly popular here?, vas ist heer be-zon-ders be-leebt?)

Example:

Tips:

* Be polite and respectful.
* If you are unsure of how to pronounce a word, ask the person you are speaking to.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help.
* Be open to trying new things.

Specific tips for asking for recommendations:

* Be specific about what you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for a restaurant recommendation, let the person know what kind of food you like or what your budget is.
* If you are asking for a product recommendation, let the person know what you need the product for or what features are important to you.
* Be open to suggestions. The person you are speaking to may have some great ideas that you hadn't thought of.
