Tips for asking questions to find out about others in German:

* Be polite. Use the formal "Sie" when speaking to someone you don't know well.
* Be respectful. Avoid asking personal questions unless you know the person well.
* Be interested. Show that you're interested in what the person has to say by asking follow-up questions.
* Be patient. It may take some time to get to know someone, especially if they're not fluent in German.

Specific tips for your question:

* If you're asking someone about their hobbies, try to ask specific questions. For example, instead of asking "Was sind deine hobbies?", you could ask "Magst du Sport?" (Do you like sports?) or "Spielst du ein Instrument?" (Do you play an instrument?)
* If you're asking someone about their family, be careful not to ask personal questions. For example, it's not appropriate to ask someone why they don't have children.
* If you're asking someone about their plans for the future, try to ask open-ended questions. For example, instead of asking "Willst du in Deutschland bleiben?" (Do you want to stay in Germany?), you could ask "Was sind deine Pläne für die Zukunft?" (What are your plans for the future?)
