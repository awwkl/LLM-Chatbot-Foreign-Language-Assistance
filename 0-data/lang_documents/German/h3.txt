Here is a tip specific to the question you asked:

* If you are new to the German language, you may want to learn a few emergency phrases in German, such as "Ich brauche Hilfe" (I need help) and "Rufen Sie einen Arzt" (Call a doctor). This will help you to communicate with the emergency dispatcher more effectively.
