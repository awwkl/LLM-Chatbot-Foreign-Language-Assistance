Here are some examples of how to introduce yourself and say where you are from in Mandarin, for someone new to the Mandarin language, formatted in point format, with pronunciation:

* 你好，我叫约翰。我来自美国。 (nǐ hǎo, wǒ jiào yuēhàn. wǒ láizì měiguó) - Hello, my name is John. I am from the United States.
* 你好，我叫约翰。我来自中国北京。 (nǐ hǎo, wǒ jiào yuēhàn. wǒ láizì zhōngguó běijīng) - Hello, my name is John. I am from Beijing, China.
* 我叫约翰，来自美国。很高兴认识你。 (wǒ jiào yuēhàn, láizì měiguó. hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ) - My name is John, from the United States. Nice to meet you.
* 我叫约翰，来自中国北京。很高兴见到你。 (wǒ jiào yuēhàn, láizì zhōngguó běijīng. hěn gāoxìng jiàn dào nǐ) - My name is John, from Beijing, China. Nice to see you.

Here are some tips specific to the question you asked:

* When introducing yourself, you can use either 我叫 (wǒ jiào) or 我的名字是 (wǒ de míngzi shì) to say "my name is." 我叫 is more casual, while 我的名字是 is more formal.
* When saying where you are from, you can use the phrase 来自 (láizì) followed by the name of your country or city. For example, 来自美国 (láizì měiguó) means "from the United States" and 来自中国北京 (láizì zhōngguó běijīng) means "from Beijing, China."
* If you are meeting someone for the first time, you can say 很高兴认识你 (hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ), which means "nice to meet you." If you are meeting someone again, you can say 很高兴见到你 (hěn gāoxìng jiàn dào nǐ), which means "nice to see you."

I hope this helps!
