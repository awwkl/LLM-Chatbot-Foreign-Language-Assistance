* Be polite. When conveying your dietary restrictions, it is always important to be polite. In Mandarin Chinese, you can use the word 请 (qǐng) - please - at the beginning of your request to show that you are being polite.
* Be patient. It is possible that the restaurant staff will not be familiar with your dietary restrictions. Be patient and be prepared to explain your needs in more detail.

* If you have a complex dietary regimen, it may be helpful to write down your restrictions in Chinese and show them to the restaurant staff.
* If you are traveling in China, it may be helpful to learn a few basic phrases about food allergies in Mandarin Chinese. For example, you could learn the phrase 我对 ____ 过敏。 (wǒ duì ____ guòmǐn) - I'm allergic to ____.
* If you are unsure whether a dish is safe for you to eat, it is always best to err on the side of caution and avoid it.
