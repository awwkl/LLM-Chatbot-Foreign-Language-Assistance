To provide your address in an emergency situation in Mandarin Chinese, you can use the following phrase:

* 我的地址是 ____。 (Wǒ de dìzhǐ shì ____.) - My address is ____. (woh deh dee-zhee shyh ____.)

Example: 我的地址是北京市海淀区上地十街10号。 (Wǒ de dìzhǐ shì Běijīng shì Hǎidiàn qū Shàngdì shí jiē 10 hào.) - My address is 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, China.

Tips:

* Be clear and concise. When giving your address in an emergency situation, it is important to be clear and concise. Make sure to state your full address, including your city, district, street name, and house number.
* Speak slowly and loudly. In an emergency situation, it is important to speak slowly and loudly so that the person on the other end of the line can hear you clearly.
* Repeat your address if necessary. If the person on the other end of the line does not understand your address, be prepared to repeat it.

Here are some additional tips for providing your address in an emergency situation:

* If you are not sure of your address in Mandarin Chinese, you can try to write it down in English and then have someone translate it for you.
* If you are calling an emergency number, such as 112, the dispatcher will likely ask for your address. Be prepared to provide this information immediately.
* If you are unable to speak Mandarin Chinese, you can try to speak to the dispatcher in English. Most dispatchers will be able to understand basic English.

I hope this helps!
