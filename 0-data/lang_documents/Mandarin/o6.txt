To ask what something is in Mandarin, you use the question word 什么 (shénme), which means "what". You can use it in the following format:

```
什么 + noun + 是 (shénme + noun + shì)
```

Here are some examples:

* 这是什么？ (zhè shì shénme?) - What is this?
* 你喜欢吃什么？ (nǐ xǐhuān chī shénme?) - What do you like to eat?
* 哪个是你的？ (nǎge shì nǐ de?) - Which one is yours?
* 这是什么意思？ (zhè shì shénme yìsi?) - What does this mean?

Here are some tips for asking what something is in Mandarin:

* If you don't know the Chinese word for something, you can point to it and say "这是什么？"
* You can also use the question word 哪个 (nǎge) to ask which one of something is yours. For example, if you're at a restaurant and you're not sure which dish is yours, you can say "哪个是我的？"
* If you're asking for the meaning of a word or phrase, you can use the phrase "这是什么意思？"

Specific tips for your question:

* When you're asking what something is, be sure to use the correct tone. The tone for 什么 is the second tone, which is a rising tone.
* If you're asking about a specific object, be sure to point to it. This will help the person you're speaking to understand your question.
* If you're asking about the meaning of a word or phrase, be sure to be as specific as possible. This will help the person you're speaking to give you a more accurate answer.

I hope this helps!
