Sure, here are some basic Mandarin Chinese phrases for asking for help with understanding something:

* 我听不懂。 (Wǒ tīng bù dǒng.) - I don't understand. (woh ting boo dong)
* 请再说一遍。 (Qǐng zài shuō yībiàn.) - Please say it again. (ching zai shwo ee-bian)
* 请解释一下。 (Qǐng jiěshì yīxià.) - Please explain. (ching jyeh-shyh ee-shah)
* 我需要你的帮助。 (Wǒ xūyào nǐ de bāngzhù.) - I need your help. (woh shyu-yaw nee deh bang-joe)
* 你能帮我理解一下吗？ (Nǐ néng bāng wǒ lǐjiě yīxià ma?) - Can you help me understand? (nee neng bang wuoh lee-jyeh ee-shah mah?)

Tips:

* Be polite. When asking for help, it is always important to be polite. In Mandarin Chinese, you can use the word 请 (qǐng) - please - at the beginning of your question to show that you are being polite.
* Be specific. If you can, try to be as specific as possible about what you don't understand. For example, instead of saying "I don't understand.", you could say "I don't understand what you mean by 'XYZ'." This will help the person to better understand what you need help with.
* Be patient. It is possible that the person you are asking for help will not be able to help you immediately. Be patient and understanding.

Here are some additional tips for asking for help with understanding something in Mandarin Chinese:

* Use gestures and facial expressions to help you communicate. For example, if you don't understand a word, you can point to it and say "什么？" (shénme?) - what?
* Don't be afraid to ask for clarification. If you still don't understand something after the person has explained it to you, don't be afraid to ask them to explain it again in a different way.
* If you are in a classroom setting, you can ask your teacher for help. Most teachers are happy to help their students understand the material.

I hope this helps!
