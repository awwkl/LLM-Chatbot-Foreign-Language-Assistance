Here are some basic Mandarin Chinese phrases for asking for help:

* 请帮帮我。 (qǐng bāng bāng wǒ.) - Please help me. (ching bang bang wuoh.)
* 你能帮我一下吗？ (nǐ néng bāng wǒ yīxià ma?) - Can you help me out? (nee neng bang wuoh ee-shah mah?)
* 我需要帮助。 (wǒ xūyào bāngzhù.) - I need help. (wuoh shyu-yaw bang-joe.)
* 麻烦你了。 (máfan nǐ le.) - Sorry to bother you. (mah-fan nee leh.)

Tips:

* Be polite. When asking for help, it is always important to be polite. In Mandarin Chinese, you can use the word 请 (qǐng) - please - at the beginning of your question to show that you are being polite.
* Be specific. If you can, try to be as specific as possible about what kind of help you need. For example, instead of saying "Can you help me?", you could say "Can you help me find the bathroom?" or "Can you help me carry my bags?" This will help the person to better understand what you need and how they can help you.
* Be patient. It is possible that the person you are asking for help will not be able to help you immediately. Be patient and understanding.
