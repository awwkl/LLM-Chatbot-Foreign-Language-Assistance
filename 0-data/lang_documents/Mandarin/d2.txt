To ask where is the nearest XXX in Mandarin Chinese, you can use the following phrase:

* 请问最近的 ____ 在哪里？ (qǐng wèn zuìjìn de ____ zài nǎ lǐ?) - Excuse me, where is the nearest ____? (ching wen zway-jin deh ____ zai nah lee?)

Example: 请问最近的银行在哪里？ (qǐng wèn zuìjìn de yínháng zài nǎ lǐ?) - Excuse me, where is the nearest bank? (ching wen zway-jin deh een-hang zai nah lee?)

Tips:

* Be specific. When asking for directions to the nearest place, be as specific as possible. For example, instead of saying "Where is the nearest bank?", you could say "Where is the nearest ATM?" or "Where is the nearest branch of the Bank of China?". This will help you to get more accurate directions.
* Be prepared to repeat yourself. It is possible that the person you are asking for directions will not understand you perfectly. Be prepared to repeat yourself or to ask the question in a different way.
* Be patient. It is also possible that the person you are asking for directions will not know the answer to your question. Be patient and try asking someone else.

Additional tips:

* You can also use the word 最近的 (zuìjìn de) - nearest - before the name of the place you are looking for to make your question more specific. For example, 最近的餐馆在哪里？ (zuìjìn de cāngguǎn zài nǎ lǐ?) - Where is the nearest restaurant?
* You can also use the word 请问 (qǐng wèn) - excuse me - at the beginning of your question to be more polite.
* If you are lost and need help, you can also ask for directions to a nearby landmark. For example, 请问去最近的地铁站怎么走？ (qǐng wèn qù zuìjìn de dìtiě zhàn zěnme zǒu?) - How do I get to the nearest subway station?

I hope this helps!
