How to ask questions to find out about others in Mandarin Chinese (for beginners)

Examples:

* 你的名字叫什么？ (nǐ de míngzi jiào shénme?) - What is your name? (nee deh ming-zhuh jiao shen-meh?)
* 你来自哪里？ (nǐ lái zì nǎ lǐ?) - Where are you from? (nee laih-dzhuh nah-lee?)
* 你多大年纪了？ (nǐ duō dà niánjì le?) - How old are you? (nee dwuo-dah nian-jee leh?)
* 你做什么工作？ (nǐ zuò shénme gōngzuò?) - What do you do for a living? (nee zweh shen-meh gong-zuoh?)
* 你有什么兴趣爱好？ (nǐ yǒu shénme xìngqù àihào?) - What are your hobbies? (nee yow shen-meh shing-chyou ai-hao?)

Tips:

* Be polite. When asking questions, it is always important to be polite. In Mandarin Chinese, you can use the word 请 (qǐng) - please - at the beginning of your question to show that you are being polite. For example, 请问你的名字叫什么？ (qǐng wèn nǐ de míngzi jiào shénme?) - Please, what is your name?
* Be specific. Instead of asking general questions like "What do you do?" or "What are your hobbies?", try to be more specific. For example, 你是老师吗？ (nǐ shì lǎoshī ma?) - Are you a teacher? or 你喜欢运动吗？ (nǐ xǐhuān yùndòng ma?) - Do you like sports? This will help you to get more detailed answers.
* Be patient. Don't be afraid to repeat yourself if you don't understand someone's answer. You can also try to ask the question in a different way. Most people will be happy to help you learn.

Additional tips for asking questions about others:

* Be mindful of cultural differences. Some questions that are considered polite in your culture may be considered rude in Chinese culture. For example, it is generally considered rude to ask someone's age in Chinese culture.
* Be respectful of people's privacy. Don't ask questions that are too personal, such as their salary or relationship status.
* Be aware of your own body language. Make eye contact and smile when asking questions. This will show that you are interested in getting to know the person.

I hope this helps!
