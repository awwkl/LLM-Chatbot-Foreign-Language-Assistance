Sure, here is a simple way to ask if a shop sells a certain item in Mandarin:

请问，你们有卖 ____ 吗？ (qǐng wèn, nǐmen yǒu mài ____ ma?) - Excuse me, do you sell ____?

To ask where the item is, you can say:

____ 在哪儿？ (____ zài nǎ lǐ?) - Where is ____?

For example, if you are looking for a book, you could say:

* 请问，你们有卖书吗？ (qǐng wèn, nǐmen yǒu mài shū ma?) - Excuse me, do you sell books?
* 书在哪儿？ (shū zài nǎ lǐ?) - Where are the books?

If you are not sure what the word for the item you are looking for is in Mandarin, you can try to describe it to the shopkeeper. For example, if you are looking for a red shirt, you could say:

* 我想买一件红色的衬衫。 (wǒ xiǎng mǎi yī jiàn hóng sè de chēn shān.) - I want to buy a red shirt.

The shopkeeper should be able to understand what you are looking for and help you find it.

Here are some additional tips for asking if a shop sells a certain item in Mandarin:

* Be polite. When asking questions, it is always important to be polite. In Mandarin Chinese, you can use the word 请 (qǐng) - please - at the beginning of your question to show that you are being polite.
* Be specific. When asking about a specific item, be sure to be as specific as possible. This will help the shopkeeper to better understand what you are looking for.
* Be patient. It is possible that the shopkeeper will not understand your question immediately. Be patient and be prepared to repeat yourself or to describe the item in more detail.

I hope this helps!
