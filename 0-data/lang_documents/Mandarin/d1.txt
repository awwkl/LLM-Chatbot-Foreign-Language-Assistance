Sure, here are some basic Mandarin Chinese phrases for asking where a place is and how to get there:

Asking where a place is:

* 请问 ____ 在哪里？ (qǐng wèn ____ zài nǎ lǐ?) - Excuse me, where is ____? (ching wen ____ zai nah lee?)

Example: 请问图书馆在哪里？ (qǐng wèn túshūguǎn zài nǎ lǐ?) - Excuse me, where is the library? (ching wen too-shoo-gwan zai nah lee?)

Asking how to get to a place:

* 去 ____ 怎么走？ (qù ____ zěnme zǒu?) - How do I get to ____? (chyu ____ zen-meh zow?)

Example: 去火车站怎么走？ (qù huǒchēzhàn zěnme zǒu?) - How do I get to the train station? (chyu hwo-che-zhan zen-meh zow?)

Tips:

* Be polite. When asking questions, it is always important to be polite. In Mandarin Chinese, you can use the word 请 (qǐng) - please - at the beginning of your question to show that you are being polite.
* Be specific. When asking for directions, try to be as specific as possible. For example, instead of saying "How do I get to the library?", you could say "How do I get to the main library on campus?". This will help you to get more accurate directions.
* Be prepared to repeat yourself. It is possible that the person you are asking for directions will not understand you perfectly. Be prepared to repeat yourself or to ask the question in a different way.
* Be patient. It is also possible that the person you are asking for directions will not know the answer to your question. Be patient and try asking someone else.

I hope this helps!
