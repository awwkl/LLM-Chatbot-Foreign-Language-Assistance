Here are some basic Mandarin Chinese phrases for asking for recommendations for food in a restaurant or what to buy in a shop:

Restaurant:

* 你们有什么特色菜？ (nǐmen yǒu shénme tèsècài?) - What are your signature dishes?
* 你们有什么推荐的菜吗？ (nǐmen yǒu shénme tuījiàn de cài ma?) - What dishes do you recommend?
* 这家店的招牌菜是什么？ (zhè jiā diàn de zhāopái cài shì shénme?) - What is the signature dish of this restaurant?

Shop:

* 你们有什么推荐的吗？ (nǐmen yǒu shénme tuījiàn de ma?) - What do you recommend?
* 你们有什么畅销产品吗？ (nǐmen yǒu shénme chàngxiāo chǎnpǐn ma?) - What are your best-selling products?
* 这家店有什么特色产品吗？ (zhè jiā diàn yǒu shénme tèsè chǎnpǐn ma?) - Does this shop have any specialty products?

Tips:

* Be polite. When asking for recommendations, it is always important to be polite. In Mandarin Chinese, you can use the word 请 (qǐng) - please - at the beginning of your request to show that you are being polite.
* Be specific. If you have any specific preferences, such as a certain type of food or budget, be sure to tell the person you are asking for recommendations. This will help them to give you more accurate recommendations.
* Be open-minded. If you are not familiar with the cuisine or products of the restaurant or shop you are in, be open to trying new things. The person you are asking for recommendations may be able to introduce you to something new that you will enjoy.

Here are some additional tips for asking for recommendations in Mandarin Chinese:

* If you are unsure of how to pronounce a phrase, you can ask the person you are speaking to to repeat it slowly or write it down for you.
* If you are not sure what something means, you can ask the person you are speaking to explain it to you.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. The person you are speaking to is likely happy to help you find the food or products you are looking for.

I hope this helps!
