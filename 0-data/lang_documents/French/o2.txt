Here are some examples of how to convey your dietary restrictions in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Je suis allergique au [allergen]. (I am allergic to [allergen].)
Pronunciation: zhuh swee ah-ler-zheek oh [allergen]

French words: Je ne peux pas manger de [food item]. (I cannot eat [food item].)
Pronunciation: zhuh nuh pwah pah man-zhay duh [food item]

French words: Je suis végétarien(ne). (I am vegetarian.)
Pronunciation: zhuh swee vay-zheh-tahr-yahn

French words: Je suis végan(e). (I am vegan.)
Pronunciation: zhuh swee vay-gahn

French words: Je suis intolérant(e) au lactose. (I am lactose intolerant.)
Pronunciation: zhuh swee an-toh-lay-rahnt oh lah-ktohs

French words: Je suis coeliaque. (I am celiac.)
Pronunciation: zhuh swee kuh-lee-ak

Tips for conveying your dietary restrictions in French:

* Be specific about your dietary restrictions. If you are allergic to peanuts, for example, say "Je suis allergique aux arachides" instead of just saying "Je suis allergique aux cacahuètes."
* If you have multiple dietary restrictions, you can list them all in a sentence. For example, you could say "Je suis allergique aux arachides et au lait."
* If you are not sure how to say something in French, you can try to describe it. For example, if you don't know how to say "lactose intolerant," you could say "Je ne peux pas digérer le lait."
* Be patient. The person you are speaking to may need to ask you clarifying questions.

Here are some additional tips specifically for the question you asked:

* If you are ordering food in a restaurant, you can let the server know about your dietary restrictions when you are seated.
* You can also ask the server if there are any menu items that you can eat.
* If you are unsure about a particular dish, you can ask the server what ingredients it contains.

I hope this helps!
