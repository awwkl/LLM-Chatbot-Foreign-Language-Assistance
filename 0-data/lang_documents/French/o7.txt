Here are some examples of how to ask if you can pay in cash or card in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Puis-je payer en espèces ou par carte ? (Can I pay in cash or by card?)
Pronunciation: pwee-zhuh pay-ay an ehs-pehs oo par kart?

French words: Acceptez-vous les espèces et les cartes ? (Do you accept cash and cards?)
Pronunciation: ahk-sep-tay-voo lay ehs-pehs ay lay kart?

French words: Quel est le mode de paiement accepté ? (What payment method is accepted?)
Pronunciation: kel ay luh mohd duh pay-mohn ahk-sep-tay?

Tips for asking if you can pay in cash or card in French:

* Be polite. Use the polite form of the verb "pouvoir" (to be able to) and "accepter" (to accept).
* If you are not sure how to say something in French, you can try to describe it. For example, if you don't know how to say "cash", you could say "le paiement avec des billets et des pièces" (payment with bills and coins).
* If you are asking someone for help, be specific about what you want to know. For example, if you know that the store accepts cash but you're not sure about cards, you could say "Acceptez-vous les cartes de crédit ?" (Do you accept credit cards?)

Additional tips:

* If you are in a hurry, you can start by saying "Excusez-moi" (excuse me) to get the cashier's attention.
* After you have been told what payment methods are accepted, you can say "Merci" (thank you).

I hope this helps!
