Here are some examples of how to ask if a shop sells a certain item in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Est-ce que vous vendez des [item name]? (Do you sell [item name]?)
Pronunciation: ay-suh kuh vooz vahn-day day [item name]?

French words: Avez-vous des [item name] en stock ? (Do you have [item name] in stock?)
Pronunciation: ah-vay-voo day day [item name] an stoh?

French words: Où puis-je trouver des [item name] ? (Where can I find [item name]?)
Pronunciation: oo pwee-zhuh troo-vay day [item name]?

French words: Pouvez-vous me montrer où sont les [item name] ? (Can you show me where the [item name] are?)
Pronunciation: poo-vay-voo mee moh-ntray oo sohn lay [item name]?

Tips for asking if a shop sells a certain item in French:

* Be specific about the item you are looking for. If you are looking for a red dress, for example, say "Est-ce que vous vendez des robes rouges ?" instead of just saying "Est-ce que vous vendez des robes ?".
* If you are not sure how to say the item you are looking for in French, you can try to describe it. For example, if you don't know how to say "red dress", you could say "Je cherche une robe de couleur rouge" (I am looking for a red dress).
* Be polite. Use the polite forms of the verbs "vendre" (to sell) and "avoir" (to have).
* If you are unsure about something, don't be afraid to ask for help. The shopkeeper will be happy to assist you.

Additional tips:

* If you are in a hurry, you can start by saying "Excusez-moi" (excuse me) to get the shopkeeper's attention.
* After you have found the item you are looking for, you can thank the shopkeeper for their help by saying "Merci" (thank you).
* If you are not sure if you want to buy the item, you can say "Je vais réfléchir" (I will think about it).

I hope this helps!
