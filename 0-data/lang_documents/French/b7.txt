Tips for asking questions to find out about others in French:

* Use the interrogative pronoun qui for questions about people.
* Use the interrogative adjective quel for questions about things.
* To ask a yes/no question, use the phrase est-ce que before the verb.
* To invert the subject and verb of a question, use the hyphen. For example: Vous aimez le café ? becomes Aimez-vous le café ?
* Be aware of the different levels of formality in French. Vous is the formal way of addressing someone, while tu is the informal way.

Here are some additional tips specifically for the question you asked:

* When asking about someone's hobbies or interests, it is helpful to use the word aimer. This means "to like" and is a good way to start a conversation about someone's passions.
* If you are not sure how to pronounce a word, you can ask the person you are speaking to to help you. Most people are happy to help others learn their language.
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language. The important thing is to keep practicing and trying to improve.

I hope this helps!
