Here are some examples of how to ask how much something costs in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Combien coûte ça ? (How much does this cost?)
Pronunciation: koh-bee-en koo-t uh sah?

French words: C'est combien ? (How much is it?)
Pronunciation: say koh-bee-en?

French words: Quel est le prix de ceci ? (What is the price of this?)
Pronunciation: kel ay luh pree duh suh-see?

Tips for asking how much something costs in French:

* Be polite. Use the polite form of the verb "coûter" (to cost).
* If you are asking about the price of a specific item, point to it or hold it up.
* If you are not sure how to say something in French, you can try to describe it. For example, if you don't know how to say "this", you could say "l'objet que je tiens dans ma main" (the object that I am holding in my hand).

Additional tips:

* If you are in a hurry, you can start by saying "Excusez-moi" (excuse me) to get the shopkeeper's attention.
* After you have been told the price, you can say "Merci" (thank you).
* If you are not sure if you want to buy the item, you can say "Je vais réfléchir" (I will think about it).

I hope this helps!
