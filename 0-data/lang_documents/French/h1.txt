Here are some examples of how to ask someone for help in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Pouvez-vous m'aider ? (Can you help me?)
Pronunciation: poo-vay-voo mee-nuh-day?

French words: Aidez-moi, s'il vous plaît. (Help me, please.)
Pronunciation: ay-day-mwah, see voo play

French words: Je suis perdu(e). Pouvez-vous m'aider ? (I am lost. Can you help me?)
Pronunciation: zhuh swee peh-rdoo. poo-vay-voo mee-nuh-day?

French words: Je ne comprends pas. Pouvez-vous m'aider ? (I don't understand. Can you help me?)
Pronunciation: zhuh nuh comp-prand pah. poo-vay-voo mee-nuh-day?

French words: Avez-vous un problème ? (Is there a problem?)
Pronunciation: ah-vay-voo un proh-blehm?

Tips for asking someone for help in French:

* Use the polite form of the verb when asking for help. For example, say pouvez-vous m'aider ? instead of peux-tu m'aider ?
* If you are not sure how to say something, you can try to describe it in French. For example, if you need help finding the bathroom, you could say Je cherche les toilettes. (I am looking for the bathroom.)
* Be sure to thank the person who helps you by saying Merci (Thank you).

Here are some additional tips specifically for the question you asked:

* If you are asking for help in a public place, such as a store or restaurant, you can address the person you are asking for help by saying Excusez-moi (Excuse me).
* If you are asking for help from someone you know, such as a friend or family member, you can address them by name.
* Be specific about what you need help with. The more specific you are, the easier it will be for the person to help you.

I hope this helps!
