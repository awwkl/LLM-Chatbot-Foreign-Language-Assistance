Here are some examples of how to ask what something is in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Qu'est-ce que c'est ? (What is this?)
Pronunciation: kess-kuh say say?

French words: Quel est le nom de cela ? (What is the name of that?)
Pronunciation: kel ay luh nom duh suh-lah?

French words: Pouvez-vous me dire ce que c'est ? (Can you tell me what this is?)
Pronunciation: poo-vay-voo mee deer suh say say?

French words: Je ne sais pas ce que c'est. (I don't know what it is.)
Pronunciation: zhuh nuh say pah suh say say.

Tips for asking what something is in French:

* Be specific about the thing you are asking about. If you are pointing to a specific object, for example, say "Qu'est-ce que c'est que Ã§a ?" (What is that?) instead of just saying "Qu'est-ce que c'est ?" (What is this?)
* If you are not sure how to say something in French, you can try to describe it. For example, if you don't know how to say "object", you could say "la chose que je tiens dans ma main" (the thing that I am holding in my hand).
* If you are asking someone for help, be polite. Use the polite form of the verb "pouvoir" (to be able to) and "dire" (to say).

Additional tips:

* If you are in a hurry, you can start by saying "Excusez-moi" (excuse me) to get the person's attention.
* After you have been told what something is, you can say "Merci" (thank you).

I hope this helps!
