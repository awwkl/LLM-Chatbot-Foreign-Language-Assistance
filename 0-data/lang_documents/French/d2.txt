To ask where the nearest XXX is in French, you can use the following phrase:

French words: Où est le plus proche XXX ?

Tips for asking where the nearest XXX is in French:

* If you are not sure of the name of the place you are looking for, you can try to describe it. For example, you could say Où est le distributeur de billets le plus proche ? (Where is the nearest ATM?)
* If you are lost, you can ask someone for help by saying Je suis perdu(e) (I am lost).
* Be sure to thank the person who helps you by saying Merci (Thank you).
