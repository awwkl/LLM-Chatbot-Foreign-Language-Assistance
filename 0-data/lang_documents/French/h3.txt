Here are some examples of how to provide your address in an emergency situation in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Je m'appelle [your name] et je suis au [your address]. (My name is [your name] and I am at [your address].)
Pronunciation: zhuh meh-nahm ay [your name] ay zhuh swee oh [your address]

French words: Mon adresse est [your address]. (My address is [your address].)
Pronunciation: mohn ah-dress ay [your address]

French words: Je suis au [number] de la rue [street name], [city], [postal code]. (I am at [number] [street name] street, [city], [postal code].)
Pronunciation: zhuh swee oh [number] duh lah rü [street name] rü, [city], [postal code]

Tips for providing your address in an emergency situation in French:

* Speak clearly and slowly.
* Repeat your address if necessary.
* If you are not sure how to say something, try to describe it. For example, if you don't know how to say "street name," you could say "the road with the big red tree."
* Be patient. The person on the phone may need to ask you clarifying questions.

Here are some additional tips specifically for the question you asked:

* If you are having trouble speaking French, you can ask for help from a friend, family member, or colleague.
* You can also use a translation app to help you communicate with the emergency dispatcher.
* Be sure to stay calm and provide the dispatcher with as much information as possible.

I hope this helps!
