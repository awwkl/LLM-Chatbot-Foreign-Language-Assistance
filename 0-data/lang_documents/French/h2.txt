Tips for asking for help with understanding something in French:

* Be specific about what you don't understand. The more specific you are, the easier it will be for the person to help you.
* Don't be afraid to ask for clarification. If you still don't understand something after the person has explained it to you, ask them to explain it again in a different way.
* Be patient. It may take some time for you to understand everything that is being said to you.

Here are some additional tips specifically for the question you asked:

* If you are having trouble understanding something in a classroom setting, you can raise your hand and ask the teacher for help.
* If you are having trouble understanding something outside of the classroom, you can ask a friend, family member, or colleague for help.
* You can also use online resources, such as dictionaries and translation tools, to help you understand French.

I hope this helps!
