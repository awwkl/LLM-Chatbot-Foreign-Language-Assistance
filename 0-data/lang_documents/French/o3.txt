Here are some examples of how to ask for recommendations for food in a restaurant or what to buy in a shop in French, for someone new to the French language:

French words: Qu'est-ce que vous me recommandez ? (What do you recommend?)
Pronunciation: kess-kuh vooz mee reh-koh-mon-day?

French words: Quelle est la spécialité du jour ? (What is the daily special?)
Pronunciation: kel ay lah speh-syah-lee-tay duh zhoor?

French words: Pouvez-vous me conseiller quelque chose ? (Can you recommend something to me?)
Pronunciation: poo-vay-voo mee kon-say-yay kek-shuh chohz?

French words: Que me conseillez-vous d'acheter ? (What do you recommend that I buy?)
Pronunciation: kuh mee kon-say-yay-voo duh-shuh-tay?

French words: Quels sont les produits les plus vendus ? (What are the best-selling products?)
Pronunciation: kel sohn lay proh-dwee lay ploo van-dü?

Tips for asking for recommendations in French:

* Be specific about what you are looking for. If you are asking for a food recommendation, for example, let the server know what kind of food you like (e.g., meat, fish, vegetarian, etc.).
* If you have any dietary restrictions, be sure to let the server or shopkeeper know.
* Be open to trying new things. The French are known for their excellent cuisine and fashion, so don't be afraid to ask for recommendations outside of your comfort zone.

Here are some additional tips specifically for the question you asked:

* When asking for a food recommendation in a restaurant, you can start by saying "Bonjour" (hello) to the server.
* Once you have been seated, you can ask for the menu by saying "Le menu, s'il vous plaît" (the menu, please).
* When you are ready to order, you can say "Je suis prêt(e) à commander" (I am ready to order).
* After you have ordered, you can say "Merci" (thank you) to the server.

* When asking for a recommendation in a shop, you can start by greeting the shopkeeper by saying "Bonjour" (hello).
* You can then ask for a recommendation by saying "Pouvez-vous me conseiller quelque chose ?" (Can you recommend something to me?) or "Que me conseillez-vous d'acheter ?" (What do you recommend that I buy?)
* If you are looking for a specific type of product, you can tell the shopkeeper what it is. For example, you could say "Je cherche une robe rouge" (I am looking for a red dress).
* Be sure to thank the shopkeeper for their help by saying "Merci" (thank you).

I hope this helps!
